"""Keeping what someone typed across a page reload.

Streamlit's session_state lives exactly as long as the websocket does. Press F5
and a new session starts, so every postcode, age and cost estimate is gone -
for a household of four that is a lot of retyping for an accidental reload.

**Why localStorage and not a cookie.** A cookie is attached to every request,
so it would be written into the reverse proxy's access log on the Synology.
What people enter here - postcode, age, what they expect to spend on doctors -
is health-adjacent, and SECURITY.md says plainly that it is never written
anywhere. localStorage never leaves the browser, so that statement stays true.
Query parameters were rejected for the same reason: they would sit in the URL,
in the browser history, in the proxy log, and would leak through the Referer
header the moment somebody clicked one of the footer links.

**The round trip.** streamlit_js_eval runs the expression in the browser and
sends the result back, which means the value is not available on the first run
- it arrives on the next. Two consequences the code below has to handle:

* `None` is ambiguous: it means both "the browser has not answered yet" and
  "nothing is stored". The read therefore appends `|| ''` so an empty string
  means "nothing stored" and only `None` means "not answered yet".
* The component caches per `key`, so a fixed key evaluates once per session.
  Writing uses a key derived from the payload, so a changed payload is a new
  component and actually runs.
